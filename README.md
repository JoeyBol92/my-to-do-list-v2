# My to-do list v2

Version 2.0 of my simple to-do list application with local storage. You can create a to-do list by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- Add task name
- Add label name
- Choose label background color
- Mark task as done
- Remove individual tasks
- Remove all tasks from to-do list

## Important changes

- Added local storage so when adding tasks they will remain visible if you close and open the index.html file again
- When you complete a task the task will be sorted at the bottom of the list
- When you uncomplete a task the task will be sorted at the top of the list
